# Ada-WinRT

This project provides a set of ADA bindings (aka language projection) to the Microsoft Windows WinRT API
and is targeted at two distinct use cases

- Windows **Store** applications
- Windows native **Desktop** applications

These bindings have been generated from the metadata describing the WinRT api provided in the
Microsoft Windows 10 SDK *Fall Creators Update (10.0.16299.91)*

### Prerequisites

You will need a working gcc/gnat **x64** Windows build environment. This release has **NOT** yet been
tested against 32 bit environments. So you may need to build gcc/gnat **x64** from source if required.
Details/scripts on how to do this can be found on thw mingw64 website.
